# Base Packer



**Base Packer** is a community-driven platform designed to share and discover starter packages and templates for various tech stacks. Users can create and contribute GitHub-based starter templates, tag them with relevant tech stacks, and filter through them to find the most suitable templates for their needs.

## Features

- **Create and Share Templates**: Users can create their startup templates and upload them to GitHub. The GitHub links can be added as base packages for the community to use.
- **Tech Stack Tags**: When adding a base package, users can tag it with the relevant tech stacks, making it easier to discover templates based on technologies used.
- **Filter by Tech Stack**: You can filter base packages by tech stack tags to find the templates that best match your project requirements.
- **Star Popular Packages**: Users can 'star' their favorite packages, and the most-starred base packages will be highlighted.
  
## Future Features (Coming Soon)

- **Blog Section**: A blog feature will allow users to share experiences, solutions to common errors, and ask for help regarding different tech stacks.
- **Error Solutions**: In the future, users will be able to add their own error solutions, share troubleshooting tips, and provide guidance on overcoming common development challenges.
  
## How It Works

1. **Create a Base Package**: Add your GitHub repo link as a base package and provide details about the tech stack used.
2. **Filter Packages**: Use the tech stack filter to find packages that suit your needs.
3. **Star Packages**: Mark your favorite base packages with a star to highlight them for others.
